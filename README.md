# atom-svn package

__This is early stage work in progress!__

The aspiration is to be a Subversion client in Atom.  The reality is
that there is almost nothing here yet.

This work would not have been possible without
[Atomatigit](https://github.com/diiq/atomatigit).  It solves a similar problem,
and I copied source code from it.  Mucho kudos to the Atomatigit team!  Thanks,
guys.

At this moment you can do cmd+shift+p and then run the "Svn: Status" command.
When you are done looking, run the "Svn: Close" command.

You're supposed to be able to use `j` and `k` to navigate between the entries in
the list, but the styling is not working, so you don't see any effect.

__Warning:__ It's hard to say whether there will ever be anything meaningful
coming out of this, so if you have input, please don't hesitate to take this
over: Contribute here, or create a new Atom package under the same name, or fork
this repo and declare your fork the canonical version.
